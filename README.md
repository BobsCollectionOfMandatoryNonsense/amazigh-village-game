Android Game Development project that started out as a school project

This project started out as a school project but I'm reviving it because the game engine I wrote for it is pretty awesome and honestly I want to continue working on it. So I'll be continue working on this game and adjusting the engine to it's needs to finally just rip out the engine and create a separate repository for the engine to then abandon this one **:D**

Here's the **retired** Trello board for this project: https://trello.com/b/IBwaeGOr/amazigh-game-https-github-com-bobdesaunois-amazigh-village-game
