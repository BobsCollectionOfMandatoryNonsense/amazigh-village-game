Android Game Development project that started out as a school project

This project utilizes the LibGDX library (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
This project started out as a school project but I'm reviving it because the game engine I wrote for it is pretty awesome.

Here's the Trello board for this project: https://trello.com/b/IBwaeGOr/amazigh-game-https-github-com-bobdesaunois-amazigh-village-game
