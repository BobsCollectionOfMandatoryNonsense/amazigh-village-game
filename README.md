# Amazigh Village Game

A school project.
The purpose is to make a game that functions on Android that in some way, shape or form has something to do with the African language "Amazigh"

## Libraries

This project utilizes the LibGDX library.
It's an abstraction layer on the LWJGL library which I've also worked with.
